# DAD JOKES FACTORY

You’re building a “Dad Jokes Factory” app. When the “Get a Dad Joke!” button is clicked, a random dad joke should appear inside a styled box.

Using the API endpoint https://icanhazdadjoke.com (which requires the header accept: application/json),

🔹 Fetch a random joke asynchronously
🔹 Display it inside a <ul> with id="jokes"
🔹 Replace the previous joke each time a new one is fetched
🔹 Handle errors gracefully if fetching fails

💭 Hint: You can use Axios for making HTTP requests.
