# TV SHOW SEARCH

Create a TV Show Search App using the provided HTML and CSS. The app should allow users to search for TV shows using the
TVMaze API
. When a user submits a search, fetch results from https://api.tvmaze.com/search/shows?q=<searchTerm> and display each
show’s image in a responsive grid layout with five images per row. If the user submits an empty search, display a
message such as “Please enter a show name.” If no shows are found for the entered term, display a message like “No shows
found for your search.” Make sure to clear previous search results before showing new ones. Using the provided HTML and
CSS, write the complete JavaScript code to implement this functionality.
