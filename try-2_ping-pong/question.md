# PING PONG GAME

Create a simple interactive Ping Pong Score Keeper game using the provided HTML and CSS. The app should allow two
players to compete by clicking their respective buttons to increase their scores. Include a dropdown menu that lets the
user select the winning score (e.g., 3, 5, 7, or 10). When one player reaches the winning score, the game should end,
both buttons should be disabled, and the winner’s score should turn green while the loser’s score turns red.
Additionally, display a message below the scoreboard (inside the `<h2 id="winnerDisplay">` element) announcing the
winner in a format such as “🎉 Player 1 won 🎊”. Implement a Reset button that clears both scores, re-enables the buttons,
removes the winner and loser styling, and updates the winner display to the default message “Game On!”. Using the
provided HTML and CSS, write the complete JavaScript logic for this functionality.
